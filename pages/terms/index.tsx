				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					5. Purchasing from Our Site
				</h2>
				<p>
					Upler is a marketplace where you can buy great products, and
					we want you to have a great experience doing so. Understand
					that Upler provides the venue where you can purchase
					Products developed by our Partners, and we do not endorse or
					guarantee any of their Products and do not assume any
					liability for them. Please read on to find out more about

					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					6. Your Content
				</h2>
				<p>
					A very important aspect of our Services is building a
					community where entrepreneurs (and others) can interact by
					posting content. But there are rules, of course.
				</p>
				<ul className="flex flex-col gap-6 pt-4">
					<li>
						When you use our Services, you may post content such as
						text, pictures, listing descriptions, reviews, comments,
						audio, videos, user names, and other materials (“Your
						Content”).
					</li>
					<li>
						You understand that you are solely responsible for Your
						Content.
					</li>
					<li>
						If Your Content is alleged to infringe another
						person&apos;s intellectual property (“IP”) or we suspect
						that it may, we will take appropriate action, such as
						disabling access to it, or terminating your account.
					</li>
					<li>
						You also agree that you will not post any content that
						is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or
						otherwise offensive or in violation of any part of our
						Terms or policies.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					7. Our Content
				</h2>
				<p>
					What&apos;s yours is yours, and what&apos;s ours is ours.
					Basically, any content related to our Services, other than
					Your Content, is owned by Upler, its licensors, or other
					providers (“Our Content”). Our Content includes the entire
					content of our website, its features, and functionality,
					including but not limited to all information, software,
					text, displays, images, video, and audio, and the designs,
					selections, and arrangements. Our Content is protected by
					United States and international copyright, trademark,
					patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or
					proprietary rights laws. You agree not to use Our Content in
					any way unless we consent in writing to your doing so.
				</p>
				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					8. Third-Party Intellectual Property
				</h2>
				<p>
					Upler&apos;s Role
					<br />
					<br />
					Upler is a marketplace composed of individual third-party
					sellers (our Partners) who develop and sell digital products
					to customers. Partners create their products, content, and
					policies and are responsible for all of their compliance
					with the law. We provide a great marketplace, but Upler does
					not create the products or Your Content or ensure that they
					comply with the law. Your Content that is uploaded on
					Upler&apos;s marketplace is not generated by employees,
					agents, or representatives of Upler. You are responsible for
					ensuring that you have all necessary rights and are not
					infringing or violating any third party&apos;s rights by
					posting it.
					<br />
					<br />
					We reserve the right to disable any listings, comments, or
					any content that we believe violates these Terms. We also
					reserve the right to take action against abusers of our
					Terms of Use, including providing assistance to third
					parties that we reasonably believe are the owners of any
					intellectual property on our marketplace.
				</p>
				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					9. Privacy
				</h2>
				<p>
					Privacy is important, and our Privacy Policy specifies how
					your information may be used when you use our Services. Do
					keep in mind that both Upler and our Partners (those selling
					products on the marketplace) need to process your
					information so you get an excellent experience on the
					marketplace and receive products you may buy. In the
					parlance of data privacy laws, Upler and our Partners may
					each be considered an independent data controller. This
					means, for example, that if a Partner accidentally exposes
					your name and email address when you use its service, the
					Partner is responsible for that.
				</p>

				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					10. Termination
				</h2>
				<p>
					If you got to go, you got to go. In general, you may
					terminate your account with Upler at any time by using your
					account settings. That said, please do review Section 2
					because additional terms regarding termination may apply to
					you.
					<br />
					<br />
					Unfortunately, in some situations, we may need to escort you
					out. We may terminate or suspend your account and your
					access to the Services if we believe for any reason that
					you, your Content, or your use of the Services violate our
					Terms. In most, but not all, situations, we will notify you
					that your account has been terminated or suspended.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you or Upler terminates or suspends your account or your
					access to the Services, you may lose access to your account
					information and Your Content. We will not be liable to you
					for the effect that any changes to the Services may have on
					you, including your income or your ability to generate
					revenue through the Services.
					<br />
					<br />
					These Terms will remain in effect even after your access to
					the Services is terminated or your use of the Services ends.
				</p>
				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					11. Enforcement and Cooperation
				</h2>
				<p>
					You agree and understand that we may do the following:
					<br />
					<br />
					Take any action with respect to any of Your Content that we
					deem appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we
					believe that Your Content violates the Terms, infringes any
					intellectual property right or other right of any person or
					entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the
					Website or the public, or could create liability for Upler.
					<br />
					<br />
					Disclose your identity or other information about you to any
					third party who claims that material posted by you violates
					their rights, including their intellectual property rights
					or their right to privacy.
					<br />
					<br />
					Take legal action, including without limitation, referral to
					law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the
					Services or violation of these terms.
					<br />
					<br />
					Cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or
					court order requesting or directing us to disclose your
					identity or other information about you. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD
					HARMLESS UPLER, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AND SERVICE
					PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY
					ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A
					CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATION BY EITHER SUCH PARTIES OR LAW
					ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.
				</p>

				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					12. Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability
				</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Purchases.</strong> You understand that Upler does
					not develop any of the products sold through our Services.
					We just provide the marketplace. The products in our
					marketplace are developed, offered, and supported by
					independent sellers (our Partners), so Upler cannot and does
					not make any warranties about their quality, safety, or even
					their legality. Any legal claim related to an item you
					purchase must be brought directly against the seller of the
					item. You release Upler from any claims related to items
					sold through our Services, including for defective items,
					misrepresentations by sellers, or items that cause damages
					to you or others.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>Content.</strong> On our Services, you may come
					across materials that you find inappropriate. We make no
					representations concerning any content posted by us or users
					through the Services. Upler is not responsible for the
					accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of
					content posted by users that you accessed through the
					Services. You release us from all liability relating to such
					content.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> Our Services may
					contain links to third-party websites or services that we
					don&apos;t own or control (for example, links to our
					Partner&apos;s sites, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). You
					may also need to use a third party&apos;s product or service
					in order to use some of our Services, such as a compatible
					computer or mobile device. When you access these third-party
					services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may
					require you to accept their own terms of use. Upler is not a
					party to those agreements.
				</p>

				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					13. Indemnification
				</h2>
				<p>
					You shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Upler and its
					officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates,
					successors, and permitted assigns (collectively,
					&ldquo;Indemnified Parties&ldquo;) against any and all
					losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions,
					judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines,
					costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including
					attorneys&apos; fees, that are incurred by Indemnified
					Parties, arising out of or related to any third-party claim
					alleging or relating to (i) your violation of the these
					Terms (including the Other Documents listed in Section 2
					that are applicable to you); (ii) your use of the Services;
					(iii) information provided by you to Upler; (iv) any
					violation of any rights of another or harm you may have
					caused (including those with respect to a third-party&apos;s
					IP rights); and (v) your violation of applicable law or
					regulations.
					<br />
					<br />
					We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we
					see it, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you
					agree to cooperate with us so we can have our legal strategy
					executed.
				</p>
				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					14. Disputes
				</h2>
				<p>
					Hopefully, we can resolve our issues on our own, but if we
					can&apos;t, you agree that the following rules shall govern
					any legal disputes involving our Services:
				</p>
				<ul className="flex flex-col gap-6 pt-4">
					<li>
						The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of
						Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and
						the laws of the United States of America.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any dispute under these Terms will be resolved through
						binding arbitration, not through the court system. All
						arbitration will be conducted in Austin, Texas unless
						both parties agree otherwise in writing in a specific
						case. All arbitration will be conducted before a single
						arbitrator following the rules of the American
						Arbitration Association.
					</li>
					<li>
						Within thirty (30) days of a final award by the single
						arbitrator, either party may appeal the award for
						reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel. The panel
						will reconsider all aspects of the initial award that
						are appealed, including related findings of fact, and
						any cross-appeals. Any award by the individual
						arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel
						award on appeal, shall be final and binding and may be
						entered as a judgment in any court of competent
						jurisdiction.
					</li>
					<li>
						No party may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring
						claims for or on behalf of two or more individuals or
						unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration
						unless those persons are parties to a single
						transaction. An award in arbitration shall determine the
						rights and obligations of the named parties only, and
						only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and
						shall not (i) determine the rights, obligations, or
						interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve
						any claim of anyone other than a named party, or (ii)
						make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone
						other than a named party. No administrator or arbitrator
						shall have the power or authority to waive, modify, or
						fail to enforce this paragraph, and any attempt to do
						so, whether by rule, policy, and arbitration decision or
						otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable. Any
						challenge to the validity of this Section shall be
						determined exclusively by a court in the State of Texas
						and not by the administrator or any arbitrator. If this
						Section shall be deemed unenforceable, then any
						proceeding in the nature of a class action shall be
						handled in a court in Austin, Texas, not in arbitration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Except as required by law, neither a party nor the
						arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or
						results of any arbitration without the prior written
						consent of the other parties.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Note that if we make any changes to this “Disputes” section
					after the date you last accepted the Terms, those changes
					will not apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding
					against AppSumo prior to the date the changes became
					effective. AppSumo will notify you of substantive changes to
					this Section at least 30 days prior to the date the change
					will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified
					terms, you may send us a written notification or close your
					account within those 30 days. By rejecting a modified term
					or permanently closing your account, you agree to arbitrate
					any disputes between you and AppSumo in accordance with the
					provisions of this Section as of the date you last accepted
					the Terms, including any changes made prior to your
					rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new
					account, you agree to be bound by the current version of the
					Terms.
				</p>

				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					15. Changes to the Terms
				</h2>
				<p>
					Upler reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at
					any time without prior notice. If we make any revisions that
					materially change the terms, we will update the
					&ldquo;Effective Date&ldquo; at the top of these Terms. Your
					continued use of the Services following the posting of
					changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. Please
					regularly review these Terms to stay informed of any updates
					or changes.
				</p>

				<h2 className="py-4 text-4xl font-semibold text-primary-color">
					16. Entire Agreement
				</h2>
				<p>
					These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, Other
					Documents listed in Section 2, and any other legal notices
					published by Upler on the Services, shall constitute the
					entire agreement between you and Upler concerning the
					Services. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid
					by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
					provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
					provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force
					and effect.
